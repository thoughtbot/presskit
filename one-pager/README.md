# thoughtbot
We design interfaces, develop applications, consult startups, and help get products to market.

# Who We Work With
Our clients are organizations of all kinds. They are optimistic and ambitious. They want customer feedback and rapid prototypes. They know designing great products and achieving product-market fit is difficult.

"The thoughtbot team worked hard to understand and refine every facet of the project. They have been spot on with their time estimates and knew the right places to push back on our rapidly expanding feature wishlist. This has been a great collaboration from start to finish, and we want to thank every team member for not just professional but outright inspired work in the face of an untested and demanding concept."

# Product Design
Who is the product for? Our designers hypothesize with you on who the target audience is. They interview prospective customers to validate assumptions. They might observe them in their environment or their use of competitive products.

They seek to understand the user's problems by sketching user flows and writing user stories. They design and build prototypes, then show them to potential users for validation. They refine the sketches and build upon them with a beautiful visual design, HTML, CSS/SASS.

# Web & Mobile Development
Our Ruby, iOS, and Android developers make the app functional, pair program, write tests, review code, and refactor mercilessly. As they write features, they set up tests and log events so we can later analyze metrics and test user acquisition channels. They deploy continuously and observe users in usability tests. 

Our mobile developers work mostly the same way as our Ruby developers. Instead of a staging environment and frequent production deploys, they release ad-hoc builds using TestFlight and deploy to the App Store once or twice a month.

# What We Charge
Our rate is $8000 per week.
